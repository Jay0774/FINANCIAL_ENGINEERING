1. Pick a minimum of 10 risky assets from the market. Use their 3-month closing price and obtain simple returns.
2. Use the mean-variance theory and build the Markowitz efficient frontier.
3. Use a risk-free asset along with the risky assets to obtain CAP"M". Draw the straight line and show that it is tangent to the efficient frontier. Obtain the market portfolio.
4. Use any three assets out of the risky assets to get three different SMLs.
